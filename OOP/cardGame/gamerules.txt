Since the rules of the game of Mau Mau (Dutch: pesten) vary a lot, this file lists the specific rules the program should use:

The game is played with a deck of 54 cards: 52 normal cards and 2 jokers.

Each player is dealt 7 cards. One card is put face-up on the table.* Cards will be put on top of this card. We will therefore
refer to it as the stack. The rest of the deck is put on the table face-down. The human player has the first turn.

A player can put one of his cards on the face-up card on the table. This card should be of either the same suit or the same value.
If the player does not have such a card, he has to draw a card from the deck. If this card is of the same suit or same value, the
player can put it on the stack right away. If he does not, it's the next player's turn.

The first player to lose all his cards is the winner.

For the following cards, there are special rules:

Ace:
	- When this card is put on the stack, the order of the turns will be inverted.
	- When there are only two players left, the player can put another card on the table.

Two:
	- When this card is put on the stack, the next player has to draw two cards from the deck. **

Seven:
	- When a player puts this card on the stack, he may immediately put another card on.

Eight:
	- When this card is put on the stack, the next player has to skip a turn.

Jack:
	- When a player puts this card on the stack, he may call the suit the next player has to put on the stack.
	- This card can be put on any suit.

King:
	- When a player puts this card on the stack, he may immediately put another card on.

Joker:
	- The joker can be put on any other card. When this card is put on the stack, the next player has to draw five cards from 
	the deck.



 *)	The first card cannot be one with the special rules. If this is the case, another card will be drawn from the deck.
**)	If the player has to draw cards from the deck because the previous player put a two or a joker on the stack, he may
	also put on another two or joker on the stack to add respectively two or five cards to the number of cards to draw,
	which the following player will have to take (or again put on another two or joker).
