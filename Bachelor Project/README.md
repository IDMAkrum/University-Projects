Bachelor Project done for the completion of my BSc in Artificial Intelligence. The project's aim was to investigate *whether sensor data from wearables could be used to make predictions on general well-being, specifically for an elderly age group.* To make predictions on the basis of the sensor data, two classifiers were built: a Random Forest (RF) classifier and a K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier. The project finished with an 8 out of 10 grade.

This folder contains the final thesis written as well as the .R code for the RF and KNN algorithms (and the data processing). The data used to train the classifiers is not included, since it is not in the public domain.
